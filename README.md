# huesâ€‚[HYOOZ]

__The accessibility javascript colors (tiny) lib.__

A color or shade of a color.

Hues is the property of colors that makes them distinct from each other, as determined by the dominant wavelength of light â€” The hue associated with the shortest wavelengths of the visible spectrum is violet.

â€” The sea has a magical turquoise hue today

- all the hues of the rainbow

## small lib

This small lib is focusing about colors and accessibility.

## What is Relative Luminance

Relative luminance follows the photometric definition of luminance, but with the values normalized to 1 or 100 for a reference white.[1] Like the photometric definition, it is related to the luminous flux density in a particular direction, which is radiant flux density weighted by the luminosity function y(Î») of the CIE Standard Observer. The use of relative values is useful in systems where absolute reproduction is impractical. For example, in prepress for print media, the absolute luminance of light reflecting off the print depends on the illumination and therefore absolute reproduction cannot be assured.

## What is WCAG

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines(WCAG) is developed by W3C WAI (The World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initiative) with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility. The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.
